Portfolio Strategy

Building a Value-Investing Portfolio

✅ Build up your portfolio gradually and wait for the “fat pitch” (great opportunities).
✅ Invest in 15-20 stocks across different countries and industries.
✅ Choose stocks with low correlation to reduce risk.
✅ Estimate intrinsic value before investing and re-evaluate annually.
✅ Sell Rules:

Sell after 3 years if the stock underperforms its market.

Sell if the stock exceeds 150% of intrinsic value.
✅ Buy More if Price Drops 25% – Only if the fundamentals remain strong.
✅ Keep a 50% margin of safety for all investments.
✅ Minimize buy/sell activity – Patience is key.
✅ Always hold at least 10% cash for future opportunities.
✅ Avoid cyclical stocks and focus on smaller, inefficiently priced markets.

Psychological Aspects of Investing

💡 Be Contrarian – Go against the crowd when needed.
💡 Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy, and Greedy When Others Are Fearful (Buffett’s Rule).
💡 Avoid emotional investing – Stick to fundamentals and valuation.
