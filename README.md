Portfolio Strategy for Value Investing

This repository provides an Excel-based Intrinsic Value Calculator designed for value investors to evaluate stocks using fundamental valuation models. The spreadsheet includes:

📊 Graham's Formula – A simple and effective method for estimating a stock's fair value.

📜 Portfolio Strategy

Building a Value-Investing Portfolio

✅ Gradual Portfolio Growth – Wait for the “fat pitch” (great opportunities).
✅ Invest in 15-20 Stocks – Across different countries and industries.
✅ Choose Stocks with Low Correlation – Reduce overall portfolio risk.
✅ Estimate Intrinsic Value Before Investing – Re-evaluate annually.
✅ Sell Rules:

📉 Sell after 3 years if the stock underperforms its market.

📈 Sell if the stock exceeds 150% of intrinsic value.
✅ Buy More if Price Drops 25% – Only if fundamentals remain strong.
✅ Maintain a 50% Margin of Safety – Avoid overpaying for stocks.
✅ Minimize Buy/Sell Activity – Patience is key.
✅ Always Hold at Least 10% Cash – Keep funds available for opportunities.
✅ Avoid Cyclical Stocks – Focus on smaller, inefficiently priced markets.

🧠 Psychological Aspects of Investing

💡 Be Contrarian – Go against the crowd when needed.
💡 Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy, and Greedy When Others Are Fearful (Buffett’s Rule).
💡 Avoid Emotional Investing – Stick to fundamentals and valuation.
